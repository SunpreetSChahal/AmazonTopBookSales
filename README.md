# Amazon Top Book Sales

Within this notebook, I analysed the 50 best-selling books from 2009 - 2019 on Amazon's marketplace. 
I aimed to find the most expensive books, compare reviews, compare user ratings, visualise the most and least popular books within the selection and more.

Analysis done using Python via Jupyter Notebooks, utilising various libraries such as; pandas, matplotlib, seaborn and more.
